This is in really early stage of development but
so far I've achieved some progress in ECS-based
design and it should be at least interesting to
look at.

For now there's only a quad and a FPS noclip camera
with the following controls:
    WASD - moving sideways
    SPACE - moving upwards
    LEFT SHIFT - moving downwards
    MOUSE - looking around (FPS-dependent yet...)

I am planning on making this a multiplayer-based game
with voxels like Minecraft or OpenBuilder, but better
with UVRE as a rendering API and ECS design. Neat!
